line 342'deki hatayı çöz.

I can see the error on line 342. There are two issues:

1. `texture::Texture` should be just `Texture` since it's already imported at the top
2. `config` should be `surface_config` based on the variable name used in this scope

Let me fix this:

It seems the `create_depth_texture` method doesn't exist on the `Texture` struct. Let me check the texture module to see what methods are available:

---

Read file: src/texture.rs

Perfect! I can see that the `create_depth_texture` method does exist in the `Texture` struct. However, there's an issue with the wgpu API that has changed. Looking at the code, there's a field `is_surface_configured: false,` in the `TextureDescriptor` which is not a valid field for the current version of wgpu.

Let me fix this by removing the problematic field:

I need to add the missing `size` field to the TextureDescriptor:

---

Perfect! Now the errors on line 342 in `renderer.rs` should be fixed. The issues were:

1. **Module reference error**: Changed `texture::Texture::create_depth_texture` to `Texture::create_depth_texture` since `Texture` is already imported.

2. **Variable name error**: Changed `&config` to `&surface_config` to match the actual variable name in scope.

3. **wgpu API compatibility**: Removed the invalid `is_surface_configured` field and added the missing `size` field in the `TextureDescriptor`.

The depth texture creation should now work correctly with your current wgpu version.
