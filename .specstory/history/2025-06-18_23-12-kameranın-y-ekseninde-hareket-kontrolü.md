Kameranın Y ekseninde boşluk tuşuyla yukarı, Ctrl tuşuyla aşağı hareket etmesini sağla.

I'll help you add Y-axis camera movement with spacebar (up) and Ctrl (down) keys. Let me first examine the current camera controller implementation.

Read file: src/camera_controller.rs

Read file: src/camera.rs

Now I understand the current camera controller structure. I need to add Y-axis movement with spacebar (up) and Ctrl (down). I'll modify the `CameraController` to include these new key bindings and movement logic.

```diff
      is_left_pressed: bool,
      is_right_pressed: bool,
+     is_up_pressed: bool,
+     is_down_pressed: bool,
      has_movement: bool,
  }
```

```diff
              is_left_pressed: false,
              is_right_pressed: false,
+             is_up_pressed: false,
+             is_down_pressed: false,
              has_movement: false,
          }
```

```diff
                  true
              }
+             KeyCode::Space => {
+                 self.is_up_pressed = is_pressed;
+                 true
+             }
+             KeyCode::ControlLeft | KeyCode::ControlRight => {
+                 self.is_down_pressed = is_pressed;
+                 true
+             }
              _ => false,
          }
```

```diff
          let forward = camera.forward();
          let right = camera.right();
+         let up = camera.up();
          
          // Calculate velocity based on pressed keys with delta time for smooth movement
```

```diff
          // Check if any movement keys are pressed
          let has_keyboard_input = self.is_forward_pressed || self.is_backward_pressed || 
-                                 self.is_left_pressed || self.is_right_pressed;
+                                 self.is_left_pressed || self.is_right_pressed ||
+                                 self.is_up_pressed || self.is_down_pressed;
          
          // Forward/Backward movement
```

```diff
              velocity -= right * movement_speed;
          }
+         
+         // Y-axis movement (up/down)
+         if self.is_up_pressed {
+             velocity += up * movement_speed;
+         }
+         if self.is_down_pressed {
+             velocity -= up * movement_speed;
+         }
          
          // Update movement status for power saving
```

Perfect! I've successfully added Y-axis camera movement to your camera controller. Here's what I added:

1. **New fields** in the `CameraController` struct:
   - `is_up_pressed`: Tracks spacebar state
   - `is_down_pressed`: Tracks Ctrl key state

2. **Key handling** in `process_events()`:
   - `KeyCode::Space`: Moves camera up
   - `KeyCode::ControlLeft | KeyCode::ControlRight`: Moves camera down (handles both left and right Ctrl keys)

3. **Movement logic** in `update_camera()`:
   - Added `up` vector from the camera
   - Included the new keys in the movement detection
   - Added Y-axis movement calculations that use the camera's up vector

Now your camera will:
- Move up when you press **Spacebar** 
- Move down when you press **Ctrl** (either left or right Ctrl)
- Maintain all existing movement (WASD for forward/backward/strafe, mouse for look around)

The movement is smooth and consistent with your existing camera speed settings, using delta time for frame-rate independent movement.
